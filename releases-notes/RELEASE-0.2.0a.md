## Implement Linked Layers

Layers can be linked to note with some optional rich text annotation.

This can be useful in a note to be able to make reference to specifics layers, especially when document contains many layers.

Also it could be just useful to virtually "group" some related layers that can't be physically grouped.


### Linked layer editor

A dedicated editor allows to add a layer to a note, or to modify one.

It's possible to apply a filter on layer's name, can be useful when document contains a huge number of layers.

### Linked layer post-it

When note is displayed as post-it, linked layers provide layer's name and optional content in the same place; in this case layer's name is displayed as italic within brackets `[ ]`

Clicking on a linked layer will activate it as current layer.


> **Notes:**
> - If a linked layer is renamed in document, no problem, note will still be linked to layer!
> - If a linked layer is deleted in document, note will still be linked to deleted layer: in this case deleted layers will be displayed with warning icon and stripped background

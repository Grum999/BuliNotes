# Buli Notes :: Release 1.0.0 [2020-11-13]

First release :-)


## Implement basic functionalities

Are implemented:
- The user interface
- Helper models
- Helper rendering style (color, line style, line width)
- Helper rendering options
- Ability to use current selection as area to render helper instead of whole image


## Implement cool stuff

The following ease of use have been implemented:
- The great *About* dialog box :-)
- When a helper is added, applied helper definition (line style, options) are automatically saved and will be proposed as default value next time
- Ability to keep plugin window opened and take in account automatically modification made on selection and/or on document size (no need to close/reopen plugin if multiple helpers have to be added to different areas)

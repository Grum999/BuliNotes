A plugin for [Krita](https://krita.org).


## What is Buli Notes?
*Buli Notes* is a Python plugin made for [Krita](https://krita.org) (free professional and open-source painting program).

## Functionalities

### Note management
All notes are available through a docker:
- List all defined notes
- Allows to add/edit/remove notes
- Lock/unlock notes
  - A locked note can't be edited/deleted
- Pin/unpin notes
  - By default an opened note is automatically closed when focus is lost; when pinned, note have to be explicitely closed
  - Pinned notes stay visibles in fullscreen mode
- Right click on list allows to copy/paste selected notes from document to another one.

As a post-it, a note can be moved/resized on desktop.


### Notes properties

Notes have the following properties:
- A Title
- A description
- A color

Also, creation and last modification date/time are automatically set on notes.

### Text content
A note can have an optional text content, that the minimal thing we can expect for a note :-D

Text editor allows rich text content and provides following formatting functions:
- Font family
- Font size
- Text weight (normal, bold)
- Text style (italic, underline, color)
- Text alignment (left, center, right, justified)
- Bullet list

Basic undo/redo and copy/paste actions are available.

### Hand written content

It's possible to set hand written notes on a scratchpad.
Could be interesting to draw small schema to illustrate ideas for example.

Hand written notes allows:
- To draw using all available Krita's preset brushes

  ![Handwritten note brushes](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliNotes/raw/main/screenshots/r0-1-0a_edit_note-handwritten-brushes.jpg)
- To change brush size
- To change brush color

  ![Handwritten note color](https://github.com/Grum999/BuliNotes/raw/main/screenshots/r0-1-0a_edit_note-handwritten-color.jpg)
- To reset content

To use scratchpad:
- Left click: draw
- Middle click: pan
- Right click: pick color

> **Note**: undo/redo is not available (and not sure to be able to implement it...)

When a note is displayed as a post-it, clicking on scratchpad will change brush color with picked color.

### Brushes list

Krita allows to manage presets (bundles, tags).
Usefull for general configuration or to organize brushes.

But when start drawing, don't want to manage all of this.
Also, don't want to create a preset for each combination size/opacity used for a specific document.

The brushes list allows you to add the current used brush in list:
- Brush preset
- Size
- Opacity
- Flow
- Blending mode

A description can be associated with brush (allows to easily keep in mind for which type of work the brush has been used)

And as note in saved into Krita file, you can do a break and came back few days or few weeks later to finish your drawing, used brushes will be available immediately!

> **Note:** brush preset is not embedded into Krita document, only reference to brush is saved

When a note is displayed as a post-it, clicking on a brush will change current brush with the selected one.


### Linked layers

Layers can be linked to notes with some rich text annotations.
This can be useful in a note to refer to specifics layers, or just to "group" some related layers.

When a note is displayed as a post-it, clicking on a linked layer will activate it as current layer.


### Embedded fonts

Fonts can be embedded in notes, if font's embeddability status allows it.
This can be useful to store font in a document for the following reasons:
- When sharing a document across different computers, ensure to always have used fonts available
- When reopening a document many years later, to be sure font is still available

> **Notes:**
> - Embeddability is defined within OpenType fonts, and sometimes Adobe Type1 fonts
> - When no embeddability information is available, plugin consider the font can't be embedded
> - According to OpenType specifications, there's 4 possible value for embeddability:
>   - **Installable**: font can be embedded and then loaded and/or extracted from note for installation
>   - **Editable**: font can be embedded and then loaded from note
>   - **Preview & Print**: font can't be embedded (as it's not possible to open a Krita document as "read-only")
>   - **Restricted**: font can't be embedded (as it's not allowed)
